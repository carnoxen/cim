Common Input Method
===================

Cim stands for Common input method.

Input methods in Linux and BSD are fragmented.
There are many input methods in Linux and BSD, such as XIM, Gtk-IM, Qt-IM, and
Wayland-IM.

Cim is software that integrates these input methods.

Already, the Gtk input method and the Qt input method are plugin methods, and
it has already been proven that there is no problem for decades when these
plugin methods are used for input.

However, since the Gtk input method and Qt input method depend on Gtk and Qt,
respectively, X-only, Java, Wayland-only, and console-only applications cannot
use such Gtk and Qt input methods.

So common input method was designed as C API, removing dependency on Gtk from
Gtk input method.

Cim is made with C API and has no dependencies, so it can be used in various
computer languages and applications.


How it works
------------

cim.h contains interfaces and types.
cim.c contains functions for applications to use input contexts.
If necessary, I plan to separate the API required by the application and
the API required by the input tools(IME).

* Location of plugins

Place the input method plugins implementing the Cim API as follows:

/usr/lib/input.d/im-sample.so
/usr/lib/input.d/im-nimf.so
/usr/lib/input.d/im-ibus.so
/usr/lib/input.d/im-uim.so
/usr/lib/input.d/im-fcitx.so
/usr/lib/input.d/im-kime.so

* Symbolic link location for plugins

It is recommended to select input plugins via a symbolic link rather than an
environment variable. This is because an environment variable may not be set in
some circumstances. Also, the symbolic link type makes it easier to create
configurators.

~/.config/cim.so is a symbolic link to the input method plugin like ibus,
fcitx, nimf, kime, uim.

ln -s /usr/lib/input.d/im-sample.so ~/.config/cim.so

* Try it

Now, when an application or GUI toolkit calls the Cim input context API, the
input method(/usr/lib/input.d/im-sample.so) works through the Cim API.

If you want to change the input method to fcitx, you can simply reset the
symbolic link.

ln -sf /usr/lib/input.d/im-fcitx.so ~/.config/cim.so

In this way, XIM, GTK-IM, QT-IM, Wayland-IM, etc. can be replaced and
integrated. However, there is a problem that input is not possible in Snap
or Flatpak. If various applications or GUI toolkits call Cim API, the input
problem in Snap or Flatpak can be easily solved by accessing
$HOME/.config/cim.so.


Integration is practically possible
-----------------------------------

Even if applications such as Wayland, Snap, Flatpak, or GUI toolkits
such as Gtk or Qt do not adopt Cim, input methods can be integrated in practice
if various bridges that implement Cim are provided.

If you use it like this, you need to set environment variables.

QT_IM_MODULE="cim"
GTK_IM_MODULE="cim"
XMODIFIERS="@im=cim"

The following plugins can call third-party input methods such as nimf, ibus,
fcitx, uim, and kime via ~/.config/cim.so.

/usr/local/lib/gtk-4.0/4.0.0/immodules/libim-cim-gtk4.so
/usr/local/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules/im-cim-gtk2.so
/usr/local/lib/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules/im-cim-gtk3.so
/usr/local/lib/qt5/plugins/platforminputcontexts/libqt5im-cim.so
/usr/local/lib/qt6/plugins/platforminputcontexts/libqt6im-cim.so

Since XIM and Wayland-IM require communication, a daemon is required.
cim-xim.so, cim-wayland.so call the Cim input context API.

/usr/local/bin/cimd
  +-- cim-xim.so
  +-- cim-wayland.so

Really technically this is possible.
However, Flatpak and Snap applications can use the input method through
~/.config/cim.so. If it is not possible, you will have to ask the developers of
Flatpak and Snap.


Benefits to input tool developers
---------------------------------

Assuming that the Cim implementation includes the above plugins and daemon,
even if the input tool(IME) developer does not implement Gtk-IM, Qt-IM, XIM and
Wayland-IM, just implementing Cim will enable typing in Gtk, Qt, X and
Wayland applications.

Assuming that you develop a new input tool(IME), it means that people can use
your input tool(IME) in all environments, such as Gtk, Qt, XIM, Wayland, and
console environments, just by implementing Cim.
